This project is a very simple website that will contain:
- basic html
- basic formatting
- some (hopefully) good practice with commit messages

By the end of this project, I hope to demonstrate these skills:
- basics of html
- making a very simple website
- how to make good commit messages

My self-reflections:

I think I did a pretty good job! Apart from the badly scaled images which are funny :D. 
I think learned the basics of git and html, including nachors, images, basic tags and even some attributes!
This project was very fun to do in my free time and also *very* productive, heh. Can't wait to learn CSS!
