This project is a very simple website that will contain:
    - basic html
    - basic formatting
    - some (hopefully) good practice with commit messages

By the end of this project, I hope to demonstrate these skills:
    - basics of html
    - making a very simple website
    - how to make good commit messages

I will add self-reflections later!
