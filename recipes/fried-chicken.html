        <h2 class="heading two">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="heading two">How-To step by step</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
                <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking 
                    dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt 
                    and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li>
                <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with 
                    the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.</li>
                <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish 
                    towel or waxed paper. <strong>LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE 
                        CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</strong></li>
                <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat 
                    until VERY hot.</li>
                <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in <strong>HOT</strong> 
                    oil on both sides.</li>
                <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will 
                    be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue 
                    to fry until crispy.</li>
                <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may 
                    have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm 
                    oven while preparing the rest.</li>
